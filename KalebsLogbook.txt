trailing commas pretier

Hi Claude, I'm working on an electron project with vue and typescript. This brought in core files like main.ts, preload, the renderer with IPCS, shims-vue.d.ts for types, and app.vue. Additionally, I am using node-gyp to run napi/native c files. This brought in core files like bindings.gyp.

manually download and install the C++ build tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
npm install bindings
node-gyp configure
